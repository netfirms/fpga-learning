# FPGA Learning

This repository documents my journey in learning FPGA development using VHDL.

## Project Structure

- **common/**: Shared VHDL components and packages.
- **docs/**: Documentation and datasheets.
- **lessons/**: Step-by-step learning projects.
  - `01_led/`: Basic LED control and switch input.
  - `02_sev_seg_count/`: 4-digit decimal counter with 7-segment display.
  - `03_buzzer/`: Passive buzzer control (PWM/Tones).
  - `04_uart/`: serial communication with PC (Loopback).
  - `05_vga/`: VGA controller (640x480 Color Bars).
  - `06_ps2_keyboard/`: PS/2 Keyboard decoder.
  - `07_lm75_temp/`: Digital Thermometer (I2C LM75 Sensor).
