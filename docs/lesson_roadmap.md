# FPGA Lesson Roadmap (RZ-EasyFPGA)

This roadmap outlines a structured learning path to master the peripherals on the **RZ-EasyFPGA A2.2** board.

## Completed Lessons
- [x] **01_led**: [Basic IO (LEDs & Switches)](../lessons/01_led)
- [x] **02_sev_seg_count**: [Time-division multiplexing, BCD counters, Debouncing](../lessons/02_sev_seg_count)
- [x] **03_buzzer**: [Passive Buzzer & PWM (Tones)](../lessons/03_buzzer)
- [x] **04_uart**: [UART Serial Communication (Loopback)](../lessons/04_uart)
- [x] **05_vga**: [VGA Controller (Color Bars)](../lessons/05_vga)
- [x] **06_ps2_keyboard**: [PS/2 Keyboard Decoder](../lessons/06_ps2_keyboard)
- [x] **07_lm75_temp**: [Digital Thermometer (I2C LM75)](../lessons/07_lm75_temp)
- [x] **08_bouncing_ball**: [Bouncing Ball Game (VGA Physics)](../lessons/08_bouncing_ball)

## Future Ideas (Advanced)
These projects explore complex features of the board:
-   **09_ir_remote**: Infrared Remote Decoding (NEC Protocol).
-   **10_lcd**: Interfacing with LCD1602 or LCD12864.
-   **11_sdram**: Writing a memory controller for the onboard SDRAM.
-   **12_nios_ii**: Running a Soft Processor (NIOS II) on the FPGA.
