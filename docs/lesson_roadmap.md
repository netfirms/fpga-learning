# FPGA Lesson Roadmap (RZ-EasyFPGA)

This roadmap outlines a structured learning path to master the peripherals on the **RZ-EasyFPGA A2.2** board.

## Completed Lessons
- [x] **01_led**: Basic IO (LEDs & Switches).
- [x] **02_sev_seg_count**: Time-division multiplexing, BCD counters, Debouncing.
- [x] **03_buzzer**: Passive Buzzer & PWM (Tones).
- [x] **04_uart**: UART Serial Communication (Loopback).
- [x] **05_vga**: VGA Controller (Color Bars).
- [x] **06_ps2_keyboard**: PS/2 Keyboard Decoder.
- [x] **07_lm75_temp**: Digital Thermometer (I2C LM75).
- [x] **08_bouncing_ball**: Bouncing Ball Game (VGA Physics).

## Future Ideas (Advanced)
These projects explore complex features of the board:
-   **09_ir_remote**: Infrared Remote Decoding (NEC Protocol).
-   **10_lcd**: Interfacing with LCD1602 or LCD12864.
-   **11_sdram**: Writing a memory controller for the onboard SDRAM.
-   **12_nios_ii**: Running a Soft Processor (NIOS II) on the FPGA.
